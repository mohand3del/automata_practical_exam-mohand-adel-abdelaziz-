Test Case 1: Equivalent DFAs
Input DFA 1:
States: 2, Start: 0, Accept: 1
Transitions: 0 a 1, 0 b 0, 1 a 1, 1 b 1
Input DFA 2: (Same as DFA 1)
Expected: The DFAs are equivalent.

Test Case 2: Non-equivalent DFAs
DFA 1 accepts strings ending with 'a'; DFA 2 ending with 'b'.
Expected: The DFAs are NOT equivalent.
